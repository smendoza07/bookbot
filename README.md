# bookbot

BookBot will take a text file and either show you how many total words are in the file, or how many times a specific letter appears in the file.

You can run the program by typing `python main.py` in the terminal. You will then be prompted to enter the name of the file you would like to analyze. After entering the file name, you will be prompted to choose between two options: counting the total number of words in the file, or counting the number of times a specific letter appears in the file. If you choose the first option, the program will return the total number of words in the file. If you choose the second option, you will be prompted to enter a letter, and the program will return the number of times that letter appears in the file.

To add books, create a new 'books' directory and you can use 'https://www.gutenberg.org/' to download books in plain text format. You can then add the books to the 'books' directory and run the program to analyze the books.
